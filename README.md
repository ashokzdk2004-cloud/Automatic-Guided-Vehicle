# Automatic-Guided-Vehicle
This project focuses on the design and development of a basic AGV system utilizing sensors, motors, and a microcontroller, such as an Arduino, to guide the vehicle along a predetermined path. The vehicle uses or ultrasonic sensors for navigation and obstacle detection, allowing it to follow a track or navigate around obstacles autonomously.
